	CHANGES IN GeoLight VERSION 1.01


OVERVIEW 

   o We thank Eli Brigde for helpful comments.
   o We thank Michael U. Kemp (Author from the RNCEP Package) to help us writing a code for exporting a trip into Google Earth
   o James Fox provided details to write a transformation script for geolocator data from Migrate Technology Ltd.
   o Some modifications to internal code.
  
NEW FUNCTIONS

   	o luxTrans
	Files with the siuffix .lux are derived from geolocators provided by Migrate Technology Ltd. 
	luxTrans() produces a table with datetime and light recordings in a format 
	required by GeoLight.
	   	
	o trip2kml
	This function creates a .kml file from light intensity measurements over time that can ve viewed as a trip in Google Earth


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	o   twilightCalc
	Code to calculate the times were light recordings pass the light intensity threshold
	were modified. Therewith wrong calculations from the first versions should not appear
	anymore. The new code is also faster. Most important, the way how users can judge
	the calculated twilight events has changed significantly. The function provides a
	very similar plot (with some more details about the date and the time of the twilight events),
	however wrong definitions can be deleted by clicking the first mouse buttom at the 
	particular twiligth event (and vice verca). Clicking the second mouse bottom will move the
	time series forwards (no backward moving is possible).

	o   changeLight
	The function got an additional argument: quantile! If this argument is specified e.g. 0.6, only
	change points with higher probabilities than 60% of all calculated probabilites will be 
	considered as changes in the movement behavior. The arguments rise.prob and set.prob will not be
	considered if quantile is defined by a value.
